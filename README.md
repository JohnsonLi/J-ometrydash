# J-ometrydash
🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓   
Jiayang and Johnson's Spring Final Project!!!    

## About
A clone of the game "Geometry Dash." You play as a block and avoid obstacles.  
We have implemented special filters including:    
    -A 'Airplane' mode instead of the norrmal jumping block.   
    -A simple level editor with save/load functions.  
    -A debug mode, where you can edit the map and switch between the modes freely.  

## How to Use  
1) Run the program in Processing.  
2) Press play and choose a level.  
3) Play the game. The only control is the spacebar.
