# J-ometrydash
🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓   
Jiayang and Johnson's Spring Final Project!!!    

## About
A clone of the game "Geometry Dash." You play as a block and avoid obstacles.  
We have implemented special filters including:    
    -A 'Airplane' mode instead of the norrmal jumping block.   
    -A simple level editor with save/load functions.  
    -A debug mode, where you can edit the map and switch between the modes freely.  

## How to Use  
1) Run the program in Processing.  
2) Press play and choose a level.  
3) Play the game. The only control is the spacebar.

## Future Plans  
* More modes of movement.  
* Better level editor with more obstacles and obstacle orientation.  
* Better looking UI and levels.  

## Known Bugs  
* Indicator for loading and saving level only appears while hovering the button.
* In plane mode, you can fly above the map.
* Sometimes spikes don't want to be removed in editing mode.
* After creating a level, level select doesn't update until restart.
* Level select doesn't scroll.  
* Bad things might happen if you don't enter anything for user input and press ok.  
* The game is super slow if the computer isn't fast.
